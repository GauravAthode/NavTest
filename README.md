# NavKalpana-RICR-NK-0016 — VoltPath (Part 1)

VoltPath is an EV Route & Charging Planner that helps users plan long-distance electric vehicle journeys by simulating battery usage and optimizing charging stops.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Electric vehicle users often face range anxiety due to uncertainty in battery consumption and charging availability.

Traditional navigation systems provide distance but do not consider energy usage or charging needs.

VoltPath addresses this by simulating battery discharge and identifying optimal charging points.

---

## 💡 Solution

VoltPath calculates:

- Route distance
- Energy required
- Safe driving range
- Charging stops
- Charging time
- Trip cost

It provides an interactive dashboard with route visualization and battery SoC tracking.
